# Plaid Link for iOS [![version][link-sdk-version]][link-sdk-url]

ðŸ“š Detailed instructions on how to integrate with Plaid Link for iOS can be found in our main documentation at [plaid.com/docs/link/ios][link-ios-docs].

ðŸ“± This repository contains sample applications in [Objective-C](LinkDemo-ObjC) and [Swift](LinkDemo-Swift) (requires Xcode 10.2) that demonstrate integration and use of Plaid Link for iOS.

###### Sample custom Link configuration in Swift

```swift
func presentPlaidLinkWithCustomConfiguration() {
        // <!-- SMARTDOWN_PRESENT_CUSTOM -->
        // With custom configuration

        let linkConfiguration = PLKConfiguration(key: "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY", env: .sandbox, product: .auth)
        linkConfiguration.clientName = "YOUR_CLIENT_NAME"

        // optional parameters
        linkConfiguration.webhook = URL(string: "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL")
        linkConfiguration.oauthRedirectUri = URL(string: "YOUR_WHITELISTED_REDIRECT_URI")
        linkConfiguration.oauthNonce = "YOUR_OAUTHNONCE1"
        linkConfiguration.countryCodes = ["COUNTRY_CODE"]
        linkConfiguration.language = "YOUR_PREFERRED_LANGUAGE"
        linkConfiguration.accountSubtypes = ["ACCOUNT_TYPE": ["ACCOUNT_SUBTYPE", "ACCOUNT_SUBTYPE"]]
        linkConfiguration.linkCustomizationName = "LINK_CUSTOMIZATION_TO_BE_USED"

        let linkViewDelegate = self
        let linkViewController = PLKPlaidLinkViewController(configuration: linkConfiguration, delegate: linkViewDelegate)
        if (UI_USER_INTERFACE_IDIOM() == .pad) {
            linkViewController.modalPresentationStyle = .formSheet
        }
        present(linkViewController, animated: true)
        // <!-- SMARTDOWN_PRESENT_CUSTOM -->
    }
```

## About the LinkDemo Xcode projects

Plaid Link can be used for different use-cases and the sample applications demonstrate how to use Plaid Link for iOS for each use-case.
For clarity between the different use cases each use case specific example showing how to integrate Plaid Link for iOS is implemented in a Swift extension and Objective-C category.

Before building and running the sample application replace any Xcode placeholder strings (like `<#GENERATED_PUBLIC_TOKEN#>`) in code with the appropriate value so that Plaid Link is configured properly. For convenience the Xcode placeholder strings are marked as compile-time warnings.

Then select your desired use-case in [`ViewController.didTapButton`](/search?q=didTapButton+extension%3Am+extension%3Aswift&unscoped_q=didTapButton+extension%3Am+extension%3Aswift) and build and run the demo application to experience the particular Link flow for yourself.

ðŸ¤– Throughout the source code there are HTML-like comments such as <code>&lt;!-- SMARTDOWN_PRESENT_CUSTOM --&gt;</code>, they are used to update the code examples in the [documentation][link-ios-docs] from the sample applicationsÊ¼ code ensuring that the examples are up-to-date and working as intended.
